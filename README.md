On 23 May, 2016, GitHub released a report describing the ethnic and gender split up of the employees. They had come a long way in terms of gender diversity. Thirty-six per cent of the 'hubbers' and 35 per cent of the leadership roles, were comprised of by women. The company released this information two years after they dealt with the lawsuit, famously filed by Julie Ann Horvath. She had accused the company of having a 'hostile work environment', based on her gender. Following the exit of Horvath, Silicon Valley and the Tech Industry's hiring policy came under the mircroscope. 

As of today, according to PayScale, only 21 per cent of the women tech executives are women. Google has been called out for paying it's women employess less than their male counterparts. GitHub the online portal for project sharing and furthering the open-source mindset, should be a more open space for everyone to contribute. 

Upon analysis of the data we find that only four per cent of the contributors were women. There are many other ways to classify the data, in terms of long term projects, the number of women from each country. Though it must be noted that while signing up some people prefer not to specify their gender identity. Some women prefer to conceal their identity, and in fact consider that to be the best option, this was proved by a research study published in 2013.

In terms, of contribution based on countries the United States leads with 105924 contributions, and the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, have one very dedicated programmer contributing to the world of open source thorugh GitHub. 

Javascript, Ruby and Python are the top three languages used for the posted code. 

When analysing this data we need to be aware of the fact that not everyone is forthcoming with the information required to to appropriately analyze the data such as, gender, and location.

Despite reports of the growing presence of women in Silicon Valley and in the Tech industry, there is still a long way to go.
